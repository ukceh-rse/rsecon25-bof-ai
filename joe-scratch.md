# Scratch space

## Abstract

Or perhaps, like us, you are struggling to know 

Or would you be happy to share your insights and perspectives with colleagues?
Do you have:
- An experience
- A positive vision of the future
- A warning or concern
that you'd like to share with RSE colleagues?


## Justification / motivation

- Early post-ChatGPT rush to put out position statements and guidance, usually top down, felt quite rushed and tick-box, in many cases have not evolved in the last 2 years despite the significant advances in the technology.

- "Best practice" doesn't cut it: best practice for whom? In persuit of what aims?

- Are you, like we are, struggling to know what advice to give your colleagues? Struggling to know what's best for yourself? Grappling with a ... ? Struggling to bring divergent xyz into a coherent / unified xyz

- This BoF session aims to achieve two things

1. a space to gather / share experiences and perspectives with RSE colleagues and a forum to share insights and raise concerns.

2. 

The session will be oriented towards this tangible output, which we hope xyz, and act as a resource that individual RSEs can draw on as they see fit in their own context (at times where they feel compelled to provide guidance)

Research Software Engineers have a unique vantage point with respect to ...,
and can (and frankly ought to) be a beacon of moderation and reason...
RSEs are some of the best placed to provide critical insight and guidance on the use of AI code generation tools.
However, RSEs tend to be distributed thinly across a large number of institutions and research groups.

We feel that this is an opportunity for RSEs to come together and speak with one voice.


## Topics / areas / questions to discuss

- How to make good use of AI as an RSE / experienced programmer (but still learner)
- Transparency in how AI was used: practical aspects; cultural aspects; publications and attribution
- Wider issues: energy/water consumption and benchmarking tools
- Open source ecosystem: AI scrapers; AI-contributions to OS projects; other mostly negative stuff frankly
- Choice of tool / platform: github versus xyz; AI editors vs web-based chatbots; "agents"; how much control to give
- Future: reinforcement learning meaning future AI code generators produce code that looks less like human written code; when does enshittification begin and what do we do about it (off ramp);
- Community / pro-social: when to knock on your colleague's door instead of prooompting
- Maintainability & tech debt
- Jobs and career prospects for RSEs

Participants might share:

- Success stories
- Frustrations / warnings to others
- Positive vision of the future
- Concerns for the future 

## Who is the guidance for?

- Researchers (but these come in many shapes and sizes..) looking to get work done and work with RSEs
- Students or less experienced programmers looking to pick up new skills
- Management
- Other RSEs

Q: does it make sense to treat RSEs, researchers and students as distinct groups here?
Perhaps it makes more sense to structure the guidance by answers to the question: what are you trying to achieve?

- I want to carry out research quickly and robustly
- I want to develop my technical skills and computational thinking
- I want to map out a research project and allocate resources appropriately
- I want to work collaboratively, e.g. with an RSE

Not sure.

## Structure of the session

### Asynchronous survey
- There will be a free-text survey that can be completed asynchronously and anonymously. 
The responses in this survey will be redacted to remove any identifiable information, and then published as a dataset. ??

#### Post-conference
- A group of volunteers will collate the information in the shared document into a position statement and guidance document.
- The final version will be shared prior to publication, and individuals may choose to (a) sign the document, (b) be credited as a contributor, or (c) not have their name anywhere on the document. *(need to think about this)*
- The final document will then be published to Zenodo (along with the survey responses?) so that it can be referenced in future.

## Structure of the position statement

- Could do benefits/risks table or subheadings + bullet points. Quite generic but perhaps important to state explicitly.
- May be worth separating short-term and long-term risks
- Points of consensus? How the hell to we determine consensus..
