# Scratch space

## Topics / areas / questions to discuss

- How to make good use of AI as an RSE / experienced programmer (but still learner)
- Transparency in how AI was used: practical aspects; cultural aspects; publications and attribution
- Wider issues: energy/water consumption and benchmarking tools
- Open source ecosystem: AI scrapers; AI-contributions to OS projects; other mostly negative stuff frankly
- Choice of tool / platform: github versus xyz; AI editors vs web-based chatbots; "agents"; how much control to give
- Future: reinforcement learning meaning future AI code generators produce code that looks less like human written code; when does enshittification begin and what do we do about it (off ramp);
- Community / pro-social: when to knock on your colleague's door instead of prooompting
- Maintainability & tech debt
- Jobs and career prospects for RSEs

Participants might share:

- Success stories
- Frustrations / warnings to others
- Positive vision of the future
- Concerns for the future 

## Who is the guidance for?

- Researchers (but these come in many shapes and sizes..) looking to get work done and work with RSEs
- Students or less experienced programmers looking to pick up new skills
- Management
- Other RSEs

Q: does it make sense to treat RSEs, researchers and students as distinct groups here?
Perhaps it makes more sense to structure the guidance by answers to the question: what are you trying to achieve?

- I want to carry out research quickly and robustly
- I want to develop my technical skills and computational thinking
- I want to map out a research project and allocate resources appropriately
- I want to work collaboratively, e.g. with an RSE

Not sure.
