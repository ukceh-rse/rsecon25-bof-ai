# Scratch space

## Topics / areas / questions to discuss

- How to make good use of AI as an RSE / experienced programmer (but still learner)
- Transparency in how AI was used: practical aspects; cultural aspects; publications and attribution
- Wider issues: energy/water consumption and benchmarking tools
- Open source ecosystem: AI scrapers; AI-contributions to OS projects; other mostly negative stuff frankly
- Choice of tool / platform: github versus xyz; AI editors vs web-based chatbots; "agents"; how much control to give
- Future: reinforcement learning meaning future AI code generators produce code that looks less like human written code; when does enshittification begin and what do we do about it (off ramp);
- Community / pro-social: when to knock on your colleague's door instead of prooompting
- Maintainability & tech debt
- Jobs and career prospects for RSEs

Participants might share:

- Success stories
- Frustrations / warnings to others
- Positive vision of the future
- Concerns for the future 

## Who is the guidance for?

- Researchers (but these come in many shapes and sizes..) looking to get work done and work with RSEs
- Students or less experienced programmers looking to pick up new skills
- Management
- Other RSEs

Q: does it make sense to treat RSEs, researchers and students as distinct groups here?
Perhaps it makes more sense to structure the guidance by answers to the question: what are you trying to achieve?

- I want to carry out research quickly and robustly
- I want to develop my technical skills and computational thinking
- I want to map out a research project and allocate resources appropriately
- I want to work collaboratively, e.g. with an RSE

Not sure.

## Structure of the session

- Shared document using https://hackmd.io/
- Breakout groups divided by topic (people can pick what's most interesting to them)

### Asynchronous survey
- There will be a free-text survey that can be completed asynchronously and anonymously. 
The responses in this survey will be redacted to remove any identifiable information, and then published as a dataset. ??

#### Post-conference
- A group of volunteers will collate the information in the shared document into a position statement and guidance document.
- The final version will be shared prior to publication, and individuals may choose to (a) sign the document, (b) be credited as a contributor, or (c) not have their name anywhere on the document. *(need to think about this)*
- The final document will then be published to Zenodo (along with the survey responses?) so that it can be referenced in future.

## Structure of the position statement

- Could do benefits/risks table or subheadings + bullet points. Quite generic but perhaps important to state explicitly.
- May be worth separating short-term and long-term risks
- Points of consensus? How the hell to we determine consensus..
