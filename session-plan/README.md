# Content plan

## First half

The first half is focused on a broad discussion based on topics chosen by participants, with opportunities to share experiences and perspectives.

- Introduction, overview of the agenda (0-10)
- Access Hackmd document, vote on topics for first breakout session (an `x` next to the topic you want to discuss) (10-15)
- First breakout session, taking notes in Hackmd doc (15-35)
- Groups share summary, key points of consensus and dissensus (add new topic ideas to hackmd) (35-50)
- Vote on topics for second breakout session (can revisit a topic) (50-55)
- Second breakout session (55-70)
- Share summary (70-85)
- Closing remarks, indication of content of second half (85-90)

This half of the BoF session could support a large number (up to 50, say) of attendees, since the breakout discussion and shared Hackmd document format is quite scalable.
The price of having a very large group would be that summaries of each group's discussions would need to be very concise, and we would need to be particularly strict on how long each representative was allowed to speak.

## Second half

The second half has an explicit focus on drafting a position statement and guidance document, drawing on the discussions from the first half.
There will already be a skeleton of the document, prepared in advance of the conference by the organisers.
However, participants will have an opportunity to change the structure and content (after an initial discussion).

- Introduction, overview of the agenda and the skeleton of the document, vote on sections for the first breakout session (0-10)
- First breakout/drafting session (10-40)
- Whole-group discussion: raise any issues/suggestions about the document structure/content, or the approach we are taking, vote on sections for second breakout session (40-55)
- Second breakout/drafting session, which may revisit the same topics or add new ones (55-85)
- Closing remarks, reiteration of how to contribute further or otherwise stay up to date with progress (85-90)

Unless planned attendance is very low in the second half, we probably want to insist that attendees who join for the second half were also present in the first, so that the have the context of the initial discussion.


## Post-conference

A group of volunteers will finalise the draft position statement and guidance document, aiming for publication on Zenodo with 6 weeks of the conference.

Prior to publication, the final version will be shared with attendees, who may choose to sign and/or be credited for their contribution.


## Hybrid delivery

We will ask participants to raise issues by writing in a dedicated section of the Hackmd, so that preferential treatment is not given to in-person/more confident people happy to raise their hand and speak up. A member of the organising team will monitor this throughout the session.

Breakout rooms that are a mix of in-person and online attendees can pose challenges.
In advance of the conference, we will seek advice from the conference organisers, e.g. on the availability of additional, noise-free spaces for hybrid breakout sessions, and of appropriate A/V technology.

Unless we feel confident that we can promise good quality hybrid breakout sessions, our strategy will be as follows:

- Make it clear to attendees from the outset that we are aiming for fully in-person or online breakout sessions, and that we cannot promise a high quality experience in a hybrid session.

- First, try to form groups that are entirely online and entirely in-person (note that having multiple breakout sessions gives us some flexibility in this regard)

- Finally, in the event that we need to form a mixed group, we will attempt to situate the mixed group in the quietest part of the room, and ask that one of the in-person participants joins the Zoom/Teams meeting from their laptop.
