# RSE Perspectives AI Code Generation Tools: Open discussion and drafting of a guidance document

## Abstract (300 words)

> Enter an abstract of your submission. This should be a brief and attention-grabbing summary of your submission.

Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has already embarked on a significant incursion into the domain of RSEs, impacting all four pillars of Research Software Engineering: development, community, training, and policy.

Do you have a positive vision for a future of Research Software Engineering with GenAI coding tools, or do you feel that there are underappreciated risks?
Are you interested in working together as a community of RSEs to shape policy and practice?
Whether you have experiences to share, questions to raise, or simply want to listen and learn, you are most welcome at this Birds of a Feather session.

GenAI sits at the intersection of a wide range of issues, making the very idea of 'best practice' troublesome and contentious, or at best strongly context-dependent.
Even so, many RSEs feel a responsibility to provide guidance and leadership on the use of these tools.

Moreover, we suspect that many RSEs are, like us, reckoning with what these technologies mean for our own professional futures.
How should we be advocating for ourselves, both today and in a future where use of GenAI coding tools is widespread and normalised? 

This session will be split into two 90 minutes halves.

* The first half will be dedicated to sharing experiences and perspectives in small break-out groups focused on topics chosen by participants.
* The second half will build on these insights to draft a position statement and guidance document on the use of GenAI tools.

We feel that RSEs have a unique vantage point on this subject, which enables us to provide authentic and relevant guidance to the wider research community.
Our ambition is to develop and publish a document that enjoys broad support among RSEs.


## Prerequisites (150 words)

> Have you considered how accessible your session will be to a diverse conference audience (attendees comprise people from academia, industry, charity and government, with skill levels from beginners to experts)? 

There are no prerequisites for this session, other than access to an internet-connected device that you are comfortable typing on.

## Outcomes (150 words)

> How will your attendees benefit from your session? What are the expected takeaways for your audience? Consider the diversity of your audience if it is a broad or general interest talk.

Attendees will have an opportunity to share insights and experiences with GenAI programming tools, learn from each other and form valuable connections.

The insights gathered in this session will form the basis of a position statement and guidance document that will attempt to represent the views of the RSE community towards these technologies.
Note that "views" does not necessarily imply consensus; we anticipate there being areas of dissensus, which may be worth including in their own right.

Attendees who remain for the second half of the session will be directly involved in the drafting of the position statement and guidance document.

**Length:**

- [ ] 90 mins
- [x] 180 mins

### First half

The first half is focused on a broad discussion based on topics chosen by participants, with opportunities to share experiences and perspectives.

- Introduction, overview of the agenda (0-10)
- Access Hackmd document, vote on topics for first breakout session (an `x` next to the topic you want to discuss) (10-15)
- First breakout session, taking notes in Hackmd doc (15-35)
- Groups share summary, key points of consensus and dissensus (add new topic ideas to hackmd) (35-50)
- Vote on topics for second breakout session (can revisit a topic) (50-55)
- Second breakout session (55-70)
- Share summary (70-85)
- Closing remarks, indication of content of second half (85-90)

This half of the BoF session could support a large number (up to 50, say) of attendees, since the breakout discussion and shared Hackmd document format is quite scalable.
The price of having a very large group would be that summaries of each group's discussions would need to be very concise, and we would need to be particularly strict on how long each representative was allowed to speak.

### Second half

The second half has an explicit focus on drafting a position statement and guidance document, drawing on the discussions from the first half.
There will already be a skeleton of the document, prepared in advance of the conference by the organisers.
However, participants will have an opportunity to change the structure and content (after an initial discussion).

- Introduction, overview of the agenda and the skeleton of the document, vote on sections for the first breakout session (0-10)
- First breakout/drafting session (10-40)
- Whole-group discussion: raise any issues/suggestions about the document structure/content, or the approach we are taking, vote on sections for second breakout session (40-55)
- Second breakout/drafting session, which may revisit the same topics or add new ones (55-85)
- Closing remarks, reiteration of how to contribute further or otherwise stay up to date with progress (85-90)

Unless planned attendance is very low in the second half, we probably want to insist that attendees who join for the second half were also present in the first, so that the have the context of the initial discussion.


### Post-conference

A group of volunteers will finalise the draft position statement and guidance document, aiming for publication on Zenodo with 6 weeks of the conference.

Prior to publication, the final version will be shared with attendees, who may choose to sign and/or be credited for their contribution.

## Accessibility

> Please comment on how you will ensure your content is accessible, which may include referring to relevant sections of the [conferenceâ€™s accessibility guidance](https://rsecon25.society-rse.org/conference-policies/accessibility/). Also note other considerations such as the contrast of colours, the shape and size of graphics and fonts, e.t.c.

- We will make sure any shared documents are accessible from one's device at the time that they are being referred to.
- HackMD documents can be viewed in dark or light mode. We will look into how to specify an appropriate font in HackMD.
- We will ask that attendees try to avoid using terminology that is likely to be confusing or unfamiliar to non-native English speakers, and will enforce this in the draft document.


## Hybrid delivery

> How will your content be delivered?

- [ ] In-Person
- [ ] Online
- [x] Hybrid (Both In-Person and Online Presenters)

> How will you ensure that both remote and in-person participants have a comparable experience? Is there anything that might pose a challenge to streaming your proposal?
> 
> We appreciate that you may not have fully-formed answers to these questions at this stage, but your responses will enable the organisers to support you in delivering a successful presentation.

- We will ask participants to raise issues by writing in a dedicated section of the Hackmd, so that preferential treatment is not given to in-person/more confident people happy to raise their hand and speak up. A member of the organising team will monitor this throughout the session.

Breakout rooms that are a mix of in-person and online attendees can pose challenges.
In advance of the conference, we will seek advice from the conference organisers, e.g. on the availability of additional, noise-free spaces for hybrid breakout sessions, and of appropriate A/V technology.

Unless we feel confident that we can promise good quality hybrid breakout sessions, our strategy will be as follows:
- Make it clear to attendees from the outset that we are aiming for fully in-person or online breakout sessions, and that we cannot promise a high quality experience in a hybrid session.
- First, try to form groups that are entirely online and entirely in-person (note that having multiple breakout sessions gives us some flexibility in this regard)
- Finally, in the event that we need to form a mixed group, we will attempt to situate the mixed group in the quietest part of the room, and ask that one of the in-person participants joins the Zoom/Teams meeting from their laptop.


## Conference theme

> Please select which of the two conference themes your submission aligns best with. If you feel it aligns well with both then please select both.

- [x] RSE and Research Excellence
- [x] RSE as Digital Research Infrastructure

## Justification for BoF session

> Why do you think your content should be given a BoF session?
>
> How will this content build or showcase a community? 

In recent _months_, let alone years, the abilities of GenAI programming tools have increased dramatically.
Broadly speaking, the response from RSEs has been fragmented; at least we are not aware of any formal, collective response that attempts to meaningfully represent the community.
This remains true even while much of the existing guidance, issued in haste in the aftermath of the launch of Chat-GPT, with coding tools mostly an afterthought, become increasingly outdated and irrelevant.

We believe that RSECon is a fantastic opportunity to attempt a more unified step forward: to construct a shared vision for the future of Research Software Engineering in a world with GenAI coding tools, and develop a coherent strategy for bringing it into being.

We feel that a BoF session dedicated to community discussions about GenAI coding tools will be extremely valuable to many of our colleagues, and serve to strengthen personal and professional ties within our community.
Technological paradigm shifts can be a source of excitement for many, but can have a destabilising or demoralising effect on others.
Unfortunately, people can be reluctant to discuss their use, or indeed lack of use, of GenAI for fear of judgement or professional consequences.
This BoF session will provide a supportive, non-judgemental space where individuals can share their experiences and perspectives with other RSEs in similar situations.

GenAI is a divisive and emotionally laden subject, and large, unstructured discussions run the risk of becoming unconstructive.
By explicitly tying the BoF session to the production of a guidance document, we hope to focus participants minds towards constructive analyses of current policy and practice, resulting in actionable guidance.
More broadly, we hope to foster a sense of a shared 'mission' - to proactively shape the future of our discipline, by recognising that we have aligned interests and working together as a community.

Our vision for the position statement and guidance document is to be more than just another DOI, but something that individual RSEs can draw on in a range of situations.
In some cases this may be just a time-saving measure, e.g. if they wish to provide guidance to a researcher they can send this document and follow up with more specific guidance if required.
In other cases, such as advocating for a certain policy or practice within their organisation, it may be useful to speak not as an individual, but with the weight of the RSE community.

> How will you disseminate and build on session content after the conference?

A group of volunteers will finalise the draft position statement and guidance document, aiming for publication on Zenodo with 6 weeks of the conference.

Prior to publication, the final version will be shared with attendees, who may choose to sign and/or be credited for their contribution.
