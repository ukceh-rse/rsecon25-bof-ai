# RSE Perspectives / Position Statement on AI Code Generation Tools

(AI Code Generation Tools: Discussion and Position Statement/ Guidance drafting)

## Abstract (300 words)

> Enter an abstract of your submission. This should be a brief and attention-grabbing summary of your submission.



## Prerequisites (150 words)

> Have you considered how accessible your session will be to a diverse conference audience (attendees comprise people from academia, industry, charity and government, with skill levels from beginners to experts)? 

There are no prerequisites for this session, other than access to an internet-connected device that you are comfortable typing on.

## Outcomes (150 words)

> How will your attendees benefit from your session? What are the expected takeaways for your audience? Consider the diversity of your audience if it is a broad or general interest talk.

Attendees will have an opportunity to share insights and experiences, learn from each other and build relationships...

The insights gathered in this session will form the basis of a position statement and guidance document that will attempt to represent the views of the RSE community towards these technologies.

Attendees who remain for the second half of the session will be directly involved in the drafting of a position statement and guidance document on the use of GenAI-based coding tools.

## Content plan

> What is your proposed schedule, including a timing breakdown?
> 
> How will you identify contributors for your session? (Including how you will align with the conference mission and ensure inclusivity, diversity and accessibility.)
> 
> Bearing in mind that you will have both in-person and online attendees, how many attendees could you reasonably support?
> 
> If applicable, what software and/or tooling will you be providing access to?
> 
> If applicable, what will attendees need to install in advance or bring along?
> 
> How will you collect discussion material?

### First half

### Second half

Second half as an explicit focus on drafting a position statement and guidance document, drawing on the discussions from the first half.
There will already be a skeleton of the document, but participants will have an opportunity to change the structure and content (after an initial discussion).

- Introduction, overview of the agenda and the skeleton of the document, vote on sections for the first breakout session (0-10)
- First breakout/drafting session (10-40)

### Post-conference

A group of volunteers will develop the draft position statement and guidance document.

The final version (aim for end of September) will be shared with attendees prior to publication.
Individuals may choose to (a) sign the document, (b) be credited as a contributor, or (c) not have their name anywhere on the document.

The final document will then be published to Zenodo.

## Accessibility

> Please comment on how you will ensure your content is accessible, which may include referring to relevant sections of the [conferenceâ€™s accessibility guidance](https://rsecon25.society-rse.org/conference-policies/accessibility/). Also note other considerations such as the contrast of colours, the shape and size of graphics and fonts, e.t.c.

Raise issues via hackmd so preferential treatment is not given to in-person/more confident people.

## Hybrid delivery

> How will you ensure that both remote and in-person participants have a comparable experience? Is there anything that might pose a challenge to streaming your proposal?
> 
> We appreciate that you may not have fully-formed answers to these questions at this stage, but your responses will enable the organisers to support you in delivering a successful presentation.

## In-Person or Online Delivery

> How will your content be delivered?

- [ ] In-Person
- [ ] Online
- [x] Hybrid (Both In-Person and Online Presenters)

## Conference theme

> Please select which of the two conference themes your submission aligns best with. If you feel it aligns well with both then please select both.

- [x] RSE and Research Excellence
- [x] RSE as Digital Research Infrastructure

## Justification for BoF session

> Why do you think your content should be given a BoF session?
> 
> How will this content build or showcase a community? 
> 
> How will you disseminate and build on session content after the conference?




# Outstanding questions

- Survey - not sure if we need this if individuals can contribute to the Hackmd document anonymously
- Does the Hackmd document get published as supplementary to the position statement? Probably not. But I feel like we would struggle to publish a document with majority but not consensus opinions, unless we were able to meaningfully represent the minority opinions too.
