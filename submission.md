# RSE Perspectives / Position Statement on AI Code Generation Tools

(AI Code Generation Tools: Discussion and Position Statement/ Guidance drafting)

## Abstract (300 words)

> Enter an abstract of your submission. This should be a brief and attention-grabbing summary of your submission.

Do you have a positive vision of a future of Research Software Engineering with GenAI coding tools, and would like to discuss how to bring it into being?
Or perhaps you have a concern and see a policy gap that needs addressing.
Do you have an experience that you think the RSE community would benefit from hearing about?
Or perhaps you are feeling overwhelmed, unsure of what this technology means for you / how to respond.
Or are you simply happy to lend your ear to colleagues?
Whatever the nature of your experience or background, you are most welcome at this BoF session.

*or perhaps instead, bullet point a list of questions we hope to discuss?*

Generative AI has already embarked on a significant incursion into the domain of RSEs, touching all four pillars of Research Software Engineering (development, community, training, and policy).

Excitement / concern / superposition of both?

We know that many RSEs feel a degree of responsibility in providing guidance and leadership on the use of these tools, which compels them - if they were not interested anyway - to seek a deeper and more nuanced understanding than most analyses provide.

Moreover, we suspect that many RSEs are, like us, reckoning with what these technologies mean for our own professional futures - how precisely should we be advocating for ourselves? What, if anything, are we asking for, and what are we promising in return for being listened to?

This session will be split into two 90 minutes halves.

1. The first half will be dedicated to sharing experiences and perspectives in small break-out groups focused on topics chosen by participants.
2. The second half aims to build on these insights to draft a position statement and guidance document on the use of GenAI tools, which we hope will be widely signed/endorsed/supported by our community.

We feel that RSEs have a unique vantage point on this subject, and can provide something of real value to those working with GenAI coding tools within and outside our community.
(a different type of leadership ?)
But this works best if we work together and speak with one voice!


## Prerequisites (150 words)

> Have you considered how accessible your session will be to a diverse conference audience (attendees comprise people from academia, industry, charity and government, with skill levels from beginners to experts)? 

There are no prerequisites for this session, other than access to an internet-connected device that you are comfortable typing on.

## Outcomes (150 words)

> How will your attendees benefit from your session? What are the expected takeaways for your audience? Consider the diversity of your audience if it is a broad or general interest talk.

Attendees will have an opportunity to share insights and experiences, learn from each other and build relationships...

The insights gathered in this session will form the basis of a position statement and guidance document that will attempt to represent the views of the RSE community towards these technologies.

Attendees who remain for the second half of the session will be directly involved in the drafting of a position statement and guidance document on the use of GenAI-based coding tools.

**Length:**

- [ ] 90 mins
- [x] 180 mins

### First half

First half is focused on discussion, sharing of experiences etc.

- Introduction, overview of the agenda (0-10)
- Access Hackmd document, vote on topics for first breakout session (an `x` next to the topic you want to discuss) (10-15)
- First breakout session, taking notes in Hackmd doc (15-35)
- Groups share summary, key points of consensus and dissensus (add new topic ideas to hackmd) (35-50)
- Vote on topics for second breakout session (can revisit a topic) (50-55)
- Second breakout session (55-70)
- Share summary (70-85)
- Closing remarks, indication of content of second half (85-90)

### Second half

Second half as an explicit focus on drafting a position statement and guidance document, drawing on the discussions from the first half.
There will already be a skeleton of the document, but participants will have an opportunity to change the structure and content (after an initial discussion).

- Introduction, overview of the agenda and the skeleton of the document, vote on sections for the first breakout session (0-10)
- First breakout/drafting session (10-40)
- Whole-group discussion: raise any issues/suggestions about the document structure/content, or the approach we are taking, vote on sections for second breakout session (40-55)
- Second breakout/drafting session (55-85)
- Closing remarks, reiteration of how to contribute further or otherwise stay up to date with progress (85-90)

### Post-conference

A group of volunteers will develop the draft position statement and guidance document.

The final version (aim for end of September) will be shared with attendees prior to publication.
Individuals may choose to (a) sign the document, (b) be credited as a contributor, or (c) not have their name anywhere on the document.

The final document will then be published to Zenodo.

## Accessibility

> Please comment on how you will ensure your content is accessible, which may include referring to relevant sections of the [conferenceâ€™s accessibility guidance](https://rsecon25.society-rse.org/conference-policies/accessibility/). Also note other considerations such as the contrast of colours, the shape and size of graphics and fonts, e.t.c.

- We will make sure any shared documents are accessible from one's device at the time that they are being referred to.
- Can you customise Hackmd colours/size yourself? I think so - can at least do dark/light mode.


## Hybrid delivery

> How will your content be delivered?

- [ ] In-Person
- [ ] Online
- [x] Hybrid (Both In-Person and Online Presenters)

> How will you ensure that both remote and in-person participants have a comparable experience? Is there anything that might pose a challenge to streaming your proposal?
> 
> We appreciate that you may not have fully-formed answers to these questions at this stage, but your responses will enable the organisers to support you in delivering a successful presentation.

- Potential difficulty: breakout rooms that are a mix of in-person and online. How do we deal with this? Do we a allow it?
- We will ask participants to raise issues by writing in a section of the hackmd, so that preferential treatment is not given to in-person/more confident people happy to raise their hand and speak up.


## Conference theme

> Please select which of the two conference themes your submission aligns best with. If you feel it aligns well with both then please select both.

- [x] RSE and Research Excellence
- [x] RSE as Digital Research Infrastructure

## Justification for BoF session

> Why do you think your content should be given a BoF session?
>
> How will this content build or showcase a community? 

Broadly speaking, the response to AI tools from RSEs has been fragmented.
We believe that RSECon is a fantastic opportunity to attempt a more unified step forward, to construct a shared vision for the future of Research Software Engineering, and develop a coherent strategy for bringing it into being.

We feel that a BoF session dedicated to community discussions about GenAI coding tools will be extremely valuable to many of our colleagues, and serve to strengthen personal and professional ties within our community.
Technological paradigm shifts can be a source of excitement for many, but can have a demoralising / destabilising effect on others; for example, if one feels as though one's expertise has abruptly diminished in value, or that one is falling behind.

Unfortunately, people can be reluctant to discuss their use, or indeed lack of use, of GenAI, for fear of judgement or even professional consequences.
This BoF session will providing a supportive, non-judgemental space where individuals can share their perspectives with other RSEs in similar situations.

By tying the session to the production of a guidance document, we hope to move quickly beyond group therapy and towards more constructive conversations - participants should come away from the session with a greater sense of clarity ...

We also feel that focusing (in the second session) on the production of a position statement and guidance document is a worthwhile and timely endeavour:

- Existing guidance, much of which was hastily written in the wake of Chat-GPT, is often too generic and outdated to be useful.
- Research software is different from commercial software - we need our own solution.
- RSEs are extremely well-positioned to provide leadership and guidance on this subject; together, we combine deep experience in software, research, teaching and management, ...
- The RSE community has aligned interests here - RSEs should not be left to fight their individual cases without the support of their community
- There is precedent for things going _really badly_ in domains where AI adoption has been driven by top-down mandates, with little organised collective action by software developers themselves. (We are in a much better position: Academia and research software has not moved quite as quickly on this as commercial software)


> How will you disseminate and build on session content after the conference?

A group of volunteers will develop the draft position statement and guidance document.

The final version (aim for end of September) will be shared with attendees prior to publication.
Individuals may choose to (a) sign the document, (b) be credited as a contributor, or (c) not have their name anywhere on the document.

The final document will then be published to Zenodo.


# Outstanding questions

- Survey - not sure if we need this if individuals can contribute to the Hackmd document anonymously
- Does the Hackmd document get published as supplementary to the position statement? Probably not. But I feel like we would struggle to publish a document with majority but not consensus opinions, unless we were able to meaningfully represent the minority opinions too.


# Scratch

Despite an initial flurry of activity as organisations raced to declare themselves...existing guidance is often too generic and outdated to be useful.

There has been a steep rise in the voluntary use of GenAI coding tools by software professionals, including many who harbour substantive concerns about the technology.
For RSEs who prefer not to use such tools themselves, 
Whether or not they are users themselves, RSEs will increasingly encounter code that has been partially or fully generated by AI --- 'opting out' is not a viable option.

How can we avoid a future where RSEs are seen as the final 'expert review' stage in a software production pipeline in which most development is performed by researchers prompting GenAI, or even worse, cut out off the software development process altogether.


- Early post-ChatGPT rush to put out position statements and guidance, usually top down, felt quite rushed and tick-box, in many cases have not evolved in the last 2 years despite the significant advances in the technology.

- Are you, like we are, struggling to know what advice to give your colleagues? Struggling to know what's best for yourself? Grappling with a ... ? Struggling to bring divergent xyz into a coherent / unified xyz

Research Software Engineers have a unique vantage point with respect to ...,
and can (and frankly ought to) be a beacon of moderation and reason...
RSEs are some of the best placed to provide critical insight and guidance on the use of AI code generation tools.


Participants might share:

- Success stories
- Frustrations / warnings to others
- Positive vision of the future
- Concerns for the future 

Tabulating generic benefits, risks and "best practice" won't cut it: best practice for whom? In pursuit of what aims?

AI code tools is unlike many subjects of BoF sessions and SIGs, whereby individuals 'opt in' due to personal or professional interest in the subject.
and impedences to the discourse between communities with different values... blah
