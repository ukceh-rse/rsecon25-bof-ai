# List of topics for potential discussion


- How to make good use of AI as an RSE / experienced programmer (but still learner)

- Transparency in how AI was used: practical aspects; cultural aspects; publications and attribution

- Wider issues: energy/water consumption and benchmarking tools

- Open source ecosystem: AI scrapers; AI-contributions to OS projects; other mostly negative stuff frankly

- Choice of tool / platform: github versus xyz; AI editors vs web-based chatbots; "agents"; how much control to give

- Future: reinforcement learning meaning future AI code generators produce code that looks less like human written code; when does enshittification begin and what do we do about it (off ramp);

- Community / pro-social: when to knock on your colleague's door instead of prooompting

- Maintainability & tech debt

- Jobs and career prospects for RSEs

- Self-advocacy: what should RSEs be demanding, and what will we promise in return?
