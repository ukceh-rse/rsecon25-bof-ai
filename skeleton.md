## Position Statement

This section summarises the consensus position of the RSE community as represented by attendees of RSECon25, with respect to the use of AI-based tools in research software.

I anticipate this being fairly high-level and not domain-specific, but it must be _RSE-specific_, and more developed and forward-thinking than what's currently out there.

It should address potential benefits and risks, separating these by time horizon (current/near future/far future), degree of certainty etc.

It should ideally paint a clear picture of a positive future in which AI is used appropriately.

It may be appropriate to highlight points of _dissensus_, framed as "open questions".

Q: how do we determine consensus?


## Guidance for use

This section contains our best efforts to develop guidelines for those operating within domains overlapping with RSE.

One option would be to split the guidance into subsections according to whether it is intended for e.g.

- Researchers (but these come in many shapes and sizes..) looking to get work done and work with RSEs
- Students or less experienced programmers looking to pick up new skills
- Management
- Other RSEs

Perhaps it makes more sense to structure the guidance by answers to the question: what are you trying to achieve?

- I want to carry out research quickly and robustly
- I want to develop my technical skills and computational thinking
- I want to map out a research project and allocate resources appropriately
- I want to work collaboratively, e.g. with an RSE

Or perhaps structure it around the research software lifecycle, including things like learning, handing over work, working collaboratively...
