This repository contains preparatory material for a 'Birds of a Feather' (BoF) session that will be run at [RSECon2025](https://rsecon25.society-rse.org/) in September. The session abstract can be found [here](https://virtual.oxfordabstracts.com/event/75166/submission/107).

Please feel free to join the conversation over at the [Discussion pages](https://github.com/ukceh-rse/rsecon25-bof-ai/discussions). Ideas, comments, questions etc are **most welcome**.

If you would like to get in touch about this session and would prefer not to use the GitHub discussion, feel free to email me at joemar\[at\]ceh.ac.uk.
